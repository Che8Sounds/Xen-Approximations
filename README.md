# Xen Approximations Calc

A macOS SwiftUI tool for exploring **xenharmonic scales** by approximating any imported `.scl` scale to **n-TET** and comparing the result visually and sonically.

- Import `.scl` (Scala) scales  
- Choose any target **n-TET** (e.g., 5, 7, 10, 12, 19, 31, â€¦)  
- See **radial visualizations** of 12-TET, your original scale, and the approximation  
- **Audition** each degree of the original scale and its approximation  (still buggy)
- **Pick & adjust** which original degree maps to each n-TET slot in the created scale, or edit the original cents directly  
- **Export** the approximation back to `.scl`
